\title{Example 1 High quality data set}
\format{
Data frame with samples in rows, and alleles in columns. Missing data is represented as "-99".
}
\description{
This is sample data copied from \link[allelematch:amExampleData]{allelematch::amExampleData} in version 5.2.1
of package \link{allelematch}. We use this data to test allelematch backwards compatibility.
}
\details{
The data in this example is simulated to represent a high quality data set that might
result from a laboratory protocol where samples were run multiple times to confirm their
identity. It has no genotyping error, a near-zero missing data load, and approximately
60\% of the individuals have been artificially resampled more than once.
