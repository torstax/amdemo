\title{Example 5 Wildlife data set}
\format{
Data frame with samples in rows, and alleles in columns. Missing data is represented as "-99".
}
\description{
This is sample data copied from \link[allelematch:amExampleData]{allelematch::amExampleData} in version 5.2.1
of package \link{allelematch}. We use this data to test allelematch backwards compatibility.
}
\details{
In this final example we use real data from the non-invasive sampling of a wildlife
population. The data have been anonymized by changing sampling details. A single
column giving the gender is also available and we show how this can be used as an extra
locus. Missing data is also more common at some loci than at others, with a total load
of about 10\%.
